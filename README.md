# react-control-statements

This library introduces a set of React.JS components that can emulate common control statements such for-loops, if statements to make the render code much more
versatile to read, to minimic control flows in other template engines such Django template Engines with 'empty' statements in loops.

This project were inspirated by [@babel-plugin-jsx-control-statements(https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-jsx-control-statements)]
 but
has the advantages of not introducing the need to install a jsx plugin, but instead make use of contexts.
